## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1.  ### To manage time with internship and building and learning the project workflows and github 
         - The challenge was overcome by managing time and starting the day early with tutorals, looking at github accounts for  reference and coding at night after learning from various external sites.

2.  ### To implement unit test cases for the first time 
         - The challenge was overcome by watching tutorials, reffering to L&T platforms like Futureskills.
