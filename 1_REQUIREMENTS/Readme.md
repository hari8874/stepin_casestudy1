 First check  wheather the person is  sitting or not.
 if the person is sitting in the seat then the knob will be turned on.
 if both the actions are true(1) then we will go for next activity
 ACTIVITY 2:
 In the second activity we will find the temparaure from the given table
 
 ADC VALUE    :   OUTPUT PWM
 0-200                 20
 210-500               25
 510-700               29
 710-1024              33


 ACTIVITY 3:
 Display the infonation by using oscilloscope



 HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: 

 1.person is switching or not
 2.displaying the temparature


 LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
 
 1.finding the temparature
 2.sending the data to display
